{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"tutorget","contentHtml":"<p>Aug 2020 - Nov 2020</p>\n<p>TutorGet is the in-semester assignment for the unit FIT5032 Web Application Development. It is designed for language learners to book lessons with their preferable tutors. I built it from scratch.</p>\n<p>This website's registered users can view the list of available tutors, send messages to them, and book lessons with the selected tutor. Users' booking history is displayed in a calendar to allow further operations of rescheduling, cancellation and rating.</p>\n<p>In addition, I made a page for the language exchange events. All the events are marked via an embedded map. Users are able to bookmark the events they are interested in.</p>\n<p>Apart from users, I also set up an admin account to manage the website. Only the admin has the authority to create/edit/delete tutor records and event records. Besides, promotion emails can be sent to all the registered users by the admin.</p>\n<p>It was the very first time for me to build a web application. I had tried my best to implement the skills I learnt from the lectures and tutorials. This hands-on experience was perfect, though more optimizations can be implemented in the near future. I didn't deploy this project to go public for the shyness of its incompetence as a commercial website. However, as my first independent work, it deserves a video demonstration.ðŸ‘‡</p>\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClOolNwQfJQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n","title":"TutorGet","date":"12/30/2020","brief":"An educational web application which allows registered users to find language tutors and book lessons.","cover":"tutorget.png","tags":"ASP.NET,C#,jQuery,Bootstrap"}},"__N_SSG":true}
