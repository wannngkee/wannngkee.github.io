{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"keeper","contentHtml":"<p>Nov 2020 - Dec 2020</p>\n<p>This project is part of the Udemy The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp course. As a newbie in web development, watching a bunch of crash courses turned out to bring me many unsolved confusions. Hence, I decided to learn everything from the basics in a more comprehensive way. It is also where I found this course very helpful.</p>\n<p>From this course, I have equipped myself with the knowledge of MERN stack(Mongo DB, Express JS, React JS, Node JS). Keeper is the project I started to be familiar with React JS and React Hooks. It looks very simple for now, but I will keep updating to integrate it with the back-end.</p>\n","title":"Keeper","date":"12/29/2020","brief":"A webpage for keeping notes.(Udemy The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp).","cover":"keeper.png","tags":"React,React Hooks,materialUI"}},"__N_SSG":true}
