Nov 2020 - Dec 2020

This project is part of the Udemy The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp course. As a newbie in web development, watching a bunch of crash courses turned out to bring me many unsolved confusions. Hence, I decided to learn everything from the basics in a more comprehensive way. It is also where I found this course very helpful.From this course, I have equipped myself with the knowledge of MERN stack(Mongo DB, Express JS, React JS, Node JS).

Keeper is the original react project from the course and I have integrated it with a back-end server deployed on Heroku. To extend the functionality, I also implemented the user authentication with Auth0.
