# TutorGet

Aug 2020 - Nov 2020

TutorGet is the in-semester assignment for the unit FIT5032 Web Application Development. It is designed for language learners to book lessons with their preferable tutors. I built it from scratch.

This website's registered users can view the list of available tutors, send messages to them, and book lessons with the selected tutor. Users' booking history is displayed in a calendar to allow further operations of rescheduling, cancellation and rating.

In addition, I made a page for the language exchange events. All the events are marked via an embedded map. Users are able to bookmark the events they are interested in.

Apart from users, I also set up an admin account to manage the website. Only the admin has the authority to create/edit/delete tutor records and event records. Besides, promotion emails can be sent to all the registered users by the admin.

It was the very first time for me to build a web application. I had tried my best to implement the skills I learnt from the lectures and tutorials. This hands-on experience was perfect, though more optimizations can be implemented in the near future. I didn't deploy this project to go public for the shyness of its incompetence as a commercial website. However, as my first independent work, it deserves a video demonstration.ðŸ‘‡
