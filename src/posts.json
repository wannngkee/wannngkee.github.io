[{"title":"TutorGet","date":"12/30/2020","brief":"An educational web application which allows registered users to find language tutors and book lessons.","cover":"tutorget.png","tags":["ASP.NET","C#","jQuery","Bootstrap"],"content":"\n# TutorGet\n\nAug 2020 to Nov 2020\n\nTutorGet is the in-semester assignment for the unit FIT5032 Web Application Development. It is a website for language learners to have lessons with their preferable tutors. I built it from scratch.\n\nThis website's registered users can view the list of available tutors, send messages to them, and book lessons with the selected tutor. Users' booking history is displayed in a calendar to allow further operations regarding rescheduling, cancel and rate.\n\nIn addition, I made a page for the language exchange events. All the events are marked via an embedded map. Users are able to bookmark the events they are interested in.\n\nApart from users, I also set up an admin role account to manage the website. Only the admin has the authority to create/edit/delete tutor records and event records. Besides, promotion emails can be sent to all the registered users by the admin.\n\nIt was the very first time for me to build a web application. I had tried my best to implement the skills I learnt from the lectures and tutorials. This hands-on experience was perfect, though more optimizations can be implemented in the near future.\n\nI didn't deploy this project to go public for the shyness of its incompetence as a commercial website. However, as my first independent work, it deserves a video demonstration.ðŸ‘‡\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClOolNwQfJQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n"},{"title":"Keeper","date":"12/29/2020","brief":"A webpage for keeping notes.(Udemy The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp).","cover":"keeper.png","tags":["React","React Hooks","materialUI"],"content":"\n# Keeper\n\nNov 2020 to Dec 2020\n\nThis project is part of the Udemy The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp course.\n"}]
